# Coding Pattern Preferences

- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code wherever possible, which means checking other areas of the codebase that might have similar code or functionality
- Write code that takes into account different environments: dev, test, and prod
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code
- Avoid writing scripts to files that are only used once
- Mocking data is only needed for tests
- Never overwrite my .env without asking first
