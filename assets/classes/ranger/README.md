# Ranger Sprite

This directory is where you should place the ranger sprite for your game.

## Recommended Sprite

We recommend using the "Animated Ranger" sprite from OpenGameArt, created by user "cheeseburger". This is a 16x16 pixel sprite that matches the style of the other character sprites in the game.

## How to Download:

1. Visit OpenGameArt.org: https://opengameart.org/content/sprites-2

2. Look for the "Animated Ranger" sprite in the collection. It's typically a small (16x16) pixel art character with a bow.

3. Download the sprite sheet.

4. Save the sprite sheet to this directory as `rangersprite.png`.

## Alternative Sprites

If you prefer a different ranger sprite, you can find many other options on OpenGameArt.org. Search for "ranger", "archer", or "hunter" sprites that match your desired style.

Some alternatives include:

- Ranger sprites from the "Twelve 16x18 RPG sprites, plus base" collection by Antifarea
- Various archer/ranger sprites in the "Enemies and characters (Pixel Art)" collection
- Noble Ranger sprite in the RPG sprites collections

Just make sure any sprite you choose is properly licensed for your use and matches the style of your game.
